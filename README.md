# Implementation_of_simple_shallow_MLP_and_RBF_NN_on_Tensorflow
In this project we are going to implement shallow Multi Layer Perceptron and Radial Basis Function Network for three 
dimensional data X,Y and Z. The project is done using Tensorflow package. This project gives basic understanding of neural network.
For more info, please, read project description file.
